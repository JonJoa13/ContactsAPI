# ContactsAPI

In order to test this API, here is a few preparation steps:
1. The user need to have SQL Server installed. 
2. Open the solution on Visual Studio 2022.
3. The connectionString in the appsettings.json has to be updated.
   "ServerName" must be replaced by the local SQL Server name of the user.
4. In Visual Studio, launch command "Update-Database" from the Package Manager Console.
   It will create the database on SQL Server.
